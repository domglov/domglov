- 👋 Hi, I’m @domglov -- I'm an Australian 🇦🇺 living in SF 🌁 working at Coalition - a cyber insurance startup. I've previously worked at Samsara, Robust Intelligence, and Chorus.ai.
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to drive growth and efficiency, whether that's generative AI, machine learning, Zapier automations, or automated Google Sheets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science at Penn (starting Fall '24) and applying it at Coalition. 
- 📫 Hit me up on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-glover/)
