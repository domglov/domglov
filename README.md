- 👋 Hi, I’m @domglov -- I'm an Australian 🇦🇺 living in SF 🌁 working at Robust Intelligence
- 👀 I’m interested in building B2B GTM organizations + growth, robust machine learning and data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of implementing data science, having spent time since joining RI studying ML from a non-technical perspective. 
- 😀 I’m always looking to learn and connect with people - I would love to trade notes on resources for learning data science! 
- 📫 Hit me up on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-glover/)
